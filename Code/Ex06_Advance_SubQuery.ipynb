    "### **Tutorial 06: Advanced Subqueries in PostgreSQL: Working with Sales.Orders Table**\n",
    "\n",
    "Subqueries in PostgreSQL allow for powerful and flexible queries by embedding one query inside another. In this tutorial, we'll explore advanced subquery techniques using the `Sales.Orders` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Find Customers with More Than Five Orders**\n",
    "This query identifies customers who have placed more than five orders:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT CustomerID\n",
    "FROM Sales.Orders\n",
    "GROUP BY CustomerID\n",
    "HAVING COUNT(OrderID) > 5;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, using a subquery:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT CustomerID\n",
    "FROM Sales.Orders\n",
    "WHERE CustomerID IN (\n",
    "    SELECT CustomerID\n",
    "    FROM Sales.Orders\n",
    "    GROUP BY CustomerID\n",
    "    HAVING COUNT(OrderID) > 5\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Retrieve Orders with the Longest Processing Time**\n",
    "To find orders with the longest processing time (from `OrderDate` to `PickingCompletedWhen`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT OrderID, (PickingCompletedWhen - OrderDate) AS ProcessingTime\n",
    "FROM Sales.Orders\n",
    "WHERE (PickingCompletedWhen - OrderDate) = (\n",
    "    SELECT MAX(PickingCompletedWhen - OrderDate)\n",
    "    FROM Sales.Orders\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Identify Backorders That Reference Nonexistent Orders**\n",
    "To check if there are backorders referencing orders that do not exist in the table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT OrderID\n",
    "FROM Sales.Orders\n",
    "WHERE BackorderOrderID IS NOT NULL\n",
    "AND BackorderOrderID NOT IN (\n",
    "    SELECT OrderID FROM Sales.Orders\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Fetch Orders with the Earliest Expected Delivery Date**\n",
    "This query retrieves orders with the earliest expected delivery date:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM Sales.Orders\n",
    "WHERE ExpectedDeliveryDate = (\n",
    "    SELECT MIN(ExpectedDeliveryDate)\n",
    "    FROM Sales.Orders\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Find Salespersons Who Have Processed Orders for the Most Customers**\n",
    "To list salespersons who have handled orders for the highest number of distinct customers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT SalespersonPersonID, COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID) AS UniqueCustomers\n",
    "FROM Sales.Orders\n",
    "GROUP BY SalespersonPersonID\n",
    "HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID) = (\n",
    "    SELECT MAX(CustomerCount)\n",
    "    FROM (\n",
    "        SELECT SalespersonPersonID, COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID) AS CustomerCount\n",
    "        FROM Sales.Orders\n",
    "        GROUP BY SalespersonPersonID\n",
    "    ) AS Subquery\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Retrieve Orders with Comments**\n",
    "To find orders where comments have been provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM Sales.Orders\n",
    "WHERE OrderID NOT IN (\n",
    "    SELECT OrderID FROM Sales.Orders\n",
    "    WHERE Comments IS NOT NULL\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Conclusion**\n",
    "Subqueries are a powerful tool in PostgreSQL for retrieving specific insights from your data. By leveraging subqueries efficiently, you can enhance the performance and readability of your queries. Experiment with these examples and adapt them to your business needs!\n",

    "### **Business Problem**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The sales team wants to understand customer ordering patterns to identify the most frequent buyers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The analytics team needs to determine which customers have placed **more than five orders** to help in targeted marketing and loyalty programs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Task**  \n",
    "Write a query that returns the data for the analytics team. Your output should include **`CustomerID` and `OrderCount`** (number of orders placed).  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Hints:**  \n",
    "- Use `COUNT(OrderID)` to determine the number of orders per customer.  \n",
    "- Filter the results to include only customers with **more than five orders**.  \n",
    "- Group by `CustomerID` to aggregate order counts properly.\n",
