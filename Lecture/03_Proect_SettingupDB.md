# **Assessment: Installing SQLite and Creating a Database for MMDT**

## **Objective**
This assessment aims to:
1. Guide you through installing SQLite on your computer.
2. Enable you to create a SQLite database for the MMDT program using the provided CSV files.
3. Provide hands-on practice importing and organizing data into a relational database.

## **Instructions**

### **Step 1: Install SQLite**
- Follow the instructions provided in the **Projects/00_Installing_SQLite** directory to install SQLite on your computer.

### **Step 2: Set Up the MMDT Database**
1. **Run Sample Code**:
   - Sample scripts are available in **Projects/01_Creating_SQLite_Database**. These scripts create individual tables for each CSV file without focusing on database design.

2. **Check the Schema**:
   - Use the provided SQL queries in **Code/Ex01_Query_Table_Information** to examine the database schema and verify the structure.

### **Step 3: Design the MMDT Database (Optional)**
1. **Draw the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**:
   - Create an ERD to visualize the relationships between tables.
   
2. **Set Up the Schema**:
   - Based on your ERD, define and implement a relational schema that organizes the data more effectively.
