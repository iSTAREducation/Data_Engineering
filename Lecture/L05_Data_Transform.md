# **Lecture 05: Data Transform, Modeling and Load**

This lecture explores the process of data transformation, modeling, and loading in the data pipeline. You will learn about different techniques for transforming raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis, various modeling approaches to derive insights, and efficient methods for loading data into storage systems.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Topics Covered**  
- **Data Transformation**: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization.  
- **Data Loading**: Best practices for storing data in databases, data warehouses, and cloud storage solutions.  
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) vs. ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)**: Understanding different pipeline architectures.  

By the end of this lecture, you will have a solid understanding of how data moves through a pipeline, from raw collection to structured insights, enabling you to build robust data workflows.
