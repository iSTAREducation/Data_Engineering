# **Assessment: Installing SQLite and Creating a Database for MMDT**

## **Objective**
This assessment aims to:
1. Guide you through installing SQLite on your computer.
2. Enable you to create a SQLite database for the MMDT program using the provided CSV files.
3. Provide hands-on practice importing and organizing data into a relational database.

---

## **Instructions**

### **Step 1: Install SQLite**
- Follow the instructions provided in the **Projects/00_Installing_SQLite** directory to install SQLite on your computer.

### **Step 2: Set Up the MMDT Database**
1. **Run Sample Code**:
   - Sample scripts are available in **Projects/01_Creating_SQLite_Database**. These scripts create individual tables for each CSV file without focusing on database design.

2. **Check the Schema**:
   - Use the provided SQL queries in **Code/Ex01_Query_Table_Information** to examine the database schema and verify the structure.

### **Step 3: Design the MMDT Database (Optional)**
1. **Draw the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**:
   - Create an ERD to visualize the relationships between tables.
   
2. **Set Up the Schema**:
   - Based on your ERD, define and implement a relational schema that organizes the data more effectively.

## **Submission Guidelines**
### **Required Submissions**:
1. **SQLite Database File**:
   - Save the database file (`mmdt.db`) in the **Projects/01_Creating_SQLite_Database/database** folder.

2. **Schema Documentation**:
   - Explain the schema generated using the default setup in Step 2. This is required only if you are not working on Step 3.

3. **SQL Query Notebook (Optional)**:
   - Include a notebook containing the SQL queries used for creating the database.

4. **Design Documentation (Optional)**:
   - Provide a brief explanation of your thought process behind the database design and schema.

### **Deadline**:
- Submit all files to the Assignments submission folder by **6 February 2025**.

### **Grading Criteria (10 Points Total)**

1. **SQLite Database File (5 Points)**  
   - Complete and accurate database file with all tables and data imported correctly.

2. **Schema Documentation (5 Points)**  
   - Clear explanation of the schema generated from the default setup (required if Step 3/4 is not completed).

3. **Optional Components (Up to 5 Points)**  
   - **SQL Query Notebook (2 Points)**: Includes relevant SQL queries for creating or exploring the database.  
   - **Design Documentation (3 Points)**: Explanation of database design, relationships, and schema improvements (if applicable).
