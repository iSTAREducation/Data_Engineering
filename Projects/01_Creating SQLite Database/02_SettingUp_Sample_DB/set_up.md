## Step 4: Write and Execute Sample Queries

Here are some example queries to explore the Northwind database:

### Query 1: Retrieve All Customers

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```

### Query 2: Find Top 5 Products by Units in Stock

```sql
SELECT TOP 5 ProductName, UnitsInStock
FROM Products
ORDER BY UnitsInStock DESC;
```

### Query 3: List Orders with Customer Details

```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.ContactName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID
ORDER BY Orders.OrderDate DESC;
```

### Query 4: Calculate Total Sales by Product

```sql
SELECT Products.ProductName, SUM([Order Details].UnitPrice * [Order Details].Quantity) AS TotalSales
FROM [Order Details]
INNER JOIN Products ON [Order Details].ProductID = Products.ProductID
GROUP BY Products.ProductName
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
```

### Query 5: Retrieve Employees in Each Region

```sql
SELECT Region, COUNT(EmployeeID) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Region;
```
