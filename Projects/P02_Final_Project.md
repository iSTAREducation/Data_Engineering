# Final Project Guidelines - Data Engineering (Beginner)

## Objectives
- Ingest and process raw data from a chosen source
- Clean and transform data using an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline
- Store the data in a structured database or data warehouse
- Perform basic analytics or reporting on the processed data
- Document and present your work effectively

## Project Requirements
### 1. **Data Ingestion**
- Retrieve data from one or more sources
- Automate data extraction if possible (e.g., API calls, web scraping, database queries)
- Store raw data in a suitable format (CSV, JSON, Parquet, etc.)

### 2. **Data Processing (ETL Pipeline)**
- Implement a basic ETL process:
  - **Extract**: Read the raw data from the storage
  - **Transform**: Clean and process the data (handling missing values, data types, duplicates)
  - **Load**: Store transformed data into a structured database (SQLite)

### 3. **Database & Querying**
- Design a schema for storing structured data
- Use SQL to query and analyze the processed data


### 4. **Visualization & Reporting** 
- Create basic dashboards or reports using a visualization tool (Tableau, Power BI, or Python libraries like Matplotlib/Seaborn)

### 5. **Code Quality & Documentation**
- Organize your code in a clear, modular structure
- Write README.md with:
  - Project description
  - Setup instructions
  - How to run the pipeline
  - Sample queries or reports
- Use comments and docstrings in your code

## Submission Requirements
- Submit your project in your personal classroom GitHub repository 
- Include all scripts, notebooks, SQL queries, and supporting files
- Provide a short presentation (5-10 slides) summarizing your project
